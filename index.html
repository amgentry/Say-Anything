    <div class="plot">
        <p>Aspiring kickboxer Lloyd Dobler falls for valedictorian Diane Court at their high school graduation ceremony.
            Lloyd lives with his sister Constance, a single mother, and has no plans for his future. Diane has had a
            sheltered academic upbringing and lives with her doting divorced father, who owns the retirement home where she
            works. She is due to attend a fellowship in England at the end of the summer.</p><br>
        <p>Diane accompanies Lloyd to a party, surprising their classmates. During a dinner at the Court household, where
            Lloyd fails to impress Diane's family, Diane's father is informed that he is under investigation by the Internal
            Revenue Service. Diane takes Lloyd to meet the residents of the retirement home and he teaches her to drive.
            Their relationship grows intimate and they sleep together, to her father's concern. Lloyd's musician friend
            Corey, who has never gotten over her cheating ex-boyfriend, warns him to take care of Diane.</p><br>
        <p>Diane's father urges her to break up with Lloyd, feeling he is not an appropriate match for her, and suggests she
            give him a pen as a parting gift. Diane tells Lloyd she wants to stop seeing him and concentrate on her studies.
            Devastated over the breakup, Lloyd seeks advice from Corey, who tells him to "be a man". Diane's father's credit
            cards are declined when he tries to buy her a luggage set.</p><br>
        <p>At dawn, Lloyd plays "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel, a song Diane loves, on a boombox under her open bedroom
            window. The next day, Diane meets with the IRS investigator, who explains that her father has been embezzling
            funds from his retirement home residents. He advises her to accept the fellowship, as matters with her father
            will worsen. After she discovers cash concealed at home, her father tells her he stole the money to give her
            financial independence. Distraught, Diane reconciles with Lloyd at the gym where he trains.</p><br>
        <p>Some time later, Diane's father has been incarcerated. Lloyd visits him in a federal penitentiary and tells him
            he will go with Diane to England; he reacts with anger. Lloyd gives him a letter from Diane saying she cannot
            forgive him, but she arrives to say goodbye and they embrace. She gives him a pen, asking him to write to her in
            England. Lloyd escorts Diane, who is afraid of flying, on her flight.</p><br>

    <div class="review">
        <h3>"One of the best films of the year—a film that is really about something, that cares deeply about the issues it
            contains—and yet it also works wonderfully as a funny, warmhearted romantic comedy."</h3>
        <p>Chicago Sun-Times</p><br><br>
        <h3>"One of the definitive Generation X movies, Say Anything is equally funny and heartfelt -- and it established
            John Cusack as an icon for left-of-center types everywhere."</h3>
        <p>Rotten Tomatoes</p><br><br>
        <h3>"It all comes down to one scene: John Cusack, standing at dusk, boom box aloft, blaring Peter Gabriel's "In Your
            Eyes" outside Ione Skye's window. This, friends, is what rapturous, heartrending, soul-spinning love is all
            about."</h3>
        <p>Entertainment Weekly</p><br><br>
        <h3>"To me, Say Anything is without a shadow of a doubt the most rewarding, funny, and likable romance of the last
            twenty years. It heralds the decency of romantic love against the gears of a cold, grinding mechanical
            world."</h3>
        <p>Film Treat Brad Laidman</p><br><br>
        <h3>"A film of warmth, insight, humor and surprising originality… [It] isn't perfect, but when it's good, which is
            every moment John Cusack is on screen, it's a living joy. And when it's not-so-good--earthbound and not
            inventive enough--it s till almost single-handedly redeems the breed."</h3>
